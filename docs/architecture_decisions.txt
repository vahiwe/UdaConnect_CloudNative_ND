I seperated the API into five microservices, namely:-
- Connections microservice
- Persons microservice
- Locations REST microservice
- Locations gRPC microservice
- Kafka Cluster
- Locations consumer microservice

I added a kafka cluster to store location data that will be processed by a consumer application.

The two locations microservice store their data in the kafka cluster. 
My rationale behind that is an assumption that location data will be sent to the application 
based on the movement of the users of the application. 
So this endpoint will receive a lot of data which might crash the system.
Adding a Kafta Cluster to the architecture, allows the location data to be processed asynchronously and reduces the load on the system.

I created a REST and gRPC API for the location service to accomodate for different clients.
REST was created because its the industry standard and a lot of clients will most likely make use of it.
gRPC was created to provide better perfomance for any client ready to interface with it.
