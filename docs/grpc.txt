The gRPC API only has two methods, namely:
- Create
- Get

The Get endpoint allows a client retrieve location details
The Create endpoint allows a client create a new location

I created two scripts to test the functionality of the two methods

To call the Get method, run:

python modules/api-location-service-gRPC/getter.py

 To call the Create method, run:

python modules/api-location-service-gRPC/writer.py
